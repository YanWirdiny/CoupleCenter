# --- Flask-Dance & OAuth setup notes ---
# 1. .env file must have no spaces around '=' and no quotes around values.
#    Example:
#    Client_ID=your-client-id
#    Client_Secret=your-client-secret
# 2. If you get 'redirect_uri_mismatch', add BOTH http://localhost:5000/login/google/authorized AND http://127.0.0.1:5000/login/google/authorized to Google Cloud Console.
# 3. Use endpoint name (not URL) for redirect_to, e.g. 'homepage' for @app.route('/')
# 4. Always restart Flask after changing .env or Google settings.
# 5. If you get 'invalid_client', double-check your client ID/secret and .env formatting.
# 6. For local development, Google treats 'localhost' and '127.0.0.1' as different, so add both as redirect URIs.
# 7. Your Flask route for login should use endpoint names, not URLs, for redirect_to.
# 8. If you change ports, update the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console to match.
# 9. After updating .env or Google settings, restart your Flask app to reload changes.
# 10. For production, use a strong, random secret key and keep it secret.

I Have sometimes a lot of word to share and I feel that I donâ€™t structure things well my mind is like a ball in closed space rebounding everywhere. Thinking abut everything about past present future where things get fully not linear. Few Days ago I got back in contact with someone I have shared a lot of memories with. I honestly can not understand the process of us starting talking again and since I'm not a fan or a believer in destiny, I can only say it is the work of God. And I firmly believe it since I never miss a day praying on that. I have been doing a lot but I think there is more to come specially from me. It is very hard to describe what I am feeling since is such a mix of feelings. I am firstly happy extremely happy waking up feeling so alive, and so good as and this warm feeling in my stomach I prayed so much for it to happen. And. You give that to me. That feeling of completeness and assurance. I'm feeling so good and happy but foremost I am feeling grateful for everything even and specially the smallest one our flirts our updates our humor our sarcasms, just right now you told me that you will do anything to have quality time with and thatâ€™s only mean the word to me you are nice extremely nice and I feel so me with you I feel that I am Yan. Im not trying to impress you intellectually or materialistically or more I just being me and showing you my world my universe what I like and listen to yours. I know you so weâ€™ll what you like what thrive you but in the same time I feel you are a lot to know you have a lot to make me discover and you have a lot to make me know about you about us cause I feel there is a learning form each other and I love that I just love that.
08/20
I Have been going through a lot this week with work. Responsibility and more and I think it will be also the case for this week I have. A lot of pressure going on that sphere to be honest but I know with God there will be a way through and I will do Good. I want to attack a difficult subject. Today when it about relationship in general but also in our case. I feel itâ€™s an important subject that I need to point out since I want to. Treat this place like a. Diary board for me and for us. The question of inspiring and losing identity through a relationship. I think this is something I am very expose to as a human since I feel I lived it a lot. First I want to make some context. I love hard I love extremely hard. And I sometime put that first involuntarily because thing are so binary in my head. The way that if its not first its last then. But Unfortunately life is not like that I need to be able to juggle Between more than one thing. I am still afraid that like I lost myself. Through the relationship and be drunk and love type of thing. Which Is. A sabotage type of reaction cause nobody need or want someone who only is interested. About love cause life is made of a whole bunch of things I know that I still need to to improve. Bette rot make time for myself to have my own. Hobbies to take care of myself physically. Emotionally and morally and not rely on. My partner for. That. Taking care of myself constantly but also there is the thing I should not exclude my person from. That growth. Cause she is my first fan you are my FIRST FAN my cheerleader. Being a man is a path that I am acknowledging. Day by day cause there is os much to learn to it but ik solving things is part of it and finding a good life balance is the whole point of life. Adulting is always good to and its better when your a loved. I feel loved but I will not use this love as a fuel 
it motivate me to do those things. But rather as an appreciation and as way of showing me that my effort are seen by my lover (YOU) and are appreciated at their worth its also a way to say donâ€™t worry even when you are failing or are blocked at things I am still here for you. To support you until you solve them cause I believe in you Yes I see your love as a way of believing in me and I want to make my love scream the same thing a way to support you and to make you feel you can do everything and you have a safe place to come to resource yourself and. Get. Back chasing and realizing your dreams.
08/28
Is this the feeling of being in love? Love is very unique since it can never be explained. To be honest. I may describe what I feel in my stomach how my brain react when I see you how my mood is when I'm around you joking and laughing it still. Is very far away of the feeling that burn inside me towards that person in particular. I think one of the best way even very selfish to describe it is by comparing what I felt for others and its so different. The consideration I have. For you the care the importance you have naturally in my hear its so unique that I feel I can try again and again but it will never get accurate but, I feel that is the whole point is to never feel like communicate it fully since its always growing and by consequent always more to share.

I want to do a big thing to ask you out to do it the most special way but honestly I want to ask just you I just want to pop up the question I want to look you in the eyes and pop up the question. But good things take time and I will take all time I have with you. Patience will always. Be the best for us it will grow our love. Always. I love you.
