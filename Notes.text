Logic for Gallery  
Here’s a plan for your gallery upload logic:

Set up a lightweight database

Use SQLite (built-in with Python) to store image filenames and notes.
Configure Flask to handle file uploads

Set an upload folder and allowed file types.
Limit uploads to 10 images per user/session.
Update your /gallery endpoint

On POST: Save the image to disk, store filename and note in the database, and enforce the 10-image limit.
On GET: Query the database and display all saved images and notes.
Update your template to show uploaded images and notes

Loop through images from the database and render them as flashcards.
